# list-operations

Program supports 9 different LinkedList operations:\
**New T1 W** - Creates new Linked list named *T1* with one node named *W*\
**InsertFirst T1 W** - Inserts node named *W* in the start of list *T1*\
**InsertLast T1 W** - Inserts node named *W* in the end of list *T1*\
**Display T1** - Prints nodes of List *T1*\
**Trains** - Prints all Lists\
**Reverse T1** - Reverses all nodes in List *T1*\
**Union T1 T2** - Push List *T2* to the end of List *T1* and deletes *T2*\
**DelFirst T1 T2** - Deletes first node of List *T1* and creates new List named *T2* containing this node\
**DelLast T1 T2** - Deletes last node of List *T1* and creates new List named *T2* containing this node\
Everything except *Trains* and *Display* is in *O(1)* complexity.
